print #print prints to the console
"" #use these to create a string '' also works
	#You can also print vars Ie. print var1 % var2
	# or do it through print var+ var2 + var3
+ adds
- subracts
* multiplys
/ divides
% percent, but it also does other things FORMAT CHARACTERS
	#Also defines vars from within strings
	#%s = if your var is a string
	#%r = if your testing -- print no matter what
	#%d = for numbers
	EXAMPLE: weight = 100
	print "I weigh %r pounds" % (weight)

	you can also assign a %formatter to a var 
		ie. formatter = "%r %r" print formatter % (1,2)

< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal
>= greater than or equal

= how you assign a variable

Formatting Outputs
"""string """ will print your output exactly like you have it in the triple parens
\ - like regex - escapes out of string, also useful for using quotes 
\n - goes to new line ex. months = "jan\nFebn\"
t - tabs - ex "\tI'm tabbed in"

raw_input() - takes what user inputs
	ex. print "how old are u"  age = raw_input() #allows user to input whatever
	To get a number for math, you have to use x = int(raw_input()) #converts answer into int using int() function
	You can also put stuff that the person sees so they know the raw_input() ex raw_input("name?")

from sys import argv (library) #from system import argument variable (or another module/library) #holds arguments defined before prgm is run. 

You then have to unpack the argv ex one, two, three = argv ##The one,two,three would be defined when typing python ex2.py apple,banana, pear

WITH FILES
open('filename', 'r+ OR w OR r') #how you open files. you can assign these to a var ex c = open(far.txt)
read() how you read in the console. you would first open() the file w a var attached (ex. x = open(file)) and then run read by var x.read()

close() : closes files
readline(): reads hyst ibe kube
truncate(): deletes all info watch out
write('words'):writes to file

generally these work like a = open('fart.txt', 'r+'), then you can use the other commands like
		a.write('fart in pants')

general things
len()  how big a file is 
exists() does the file exist
